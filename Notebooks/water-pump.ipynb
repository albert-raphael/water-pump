    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In this project, I will develop machine learning models to predict the functionality status of water pumps across Tanzania based on a variety of features including location, water quality, management structure, and technical specifications. This project addresses a critical infrastructure challenge: identifying which water pumps are functional, which need repairs, and which are non-functional to improve maintenance operations and ensure communities have access to clean water.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Competition Link\n",
    "[DrivenData - Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "1. Develop classification models to predict three target classes:\n",
    "   - Functional water pumps\n",
    "   - Water pumps that need repair\n",
    "   - Non-functional water pumps\n",
    "2. Analyze which factors most strongly influence water pump functionality\n",
    "3. Create geospatial visualizations to communicate findings effectively\n",
    "4. Deploy a simple dashboard to showcase models and insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Source\n",
    "The data comes from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, which aggregates information about water points across Tanzania.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains 40+ columns representing:\n",
    "- Geographic information (coordinates, region, basin)\n",
    "- Technical specifications (pump type, extraction method)\n",
    "- Management details (installer, funder, payment type)\n",
    "- Water characteristics (quality, quantity, source)\n",
    "- Temporal information (construction year, recording date)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable\n",
    "- **status_group**: The operating condition of the waterpoint with three possible values:\n",
    "  - `functional` - operational with no repairs needed\n",
    "  - `functional needs repair` - operational but needs repairs\n",
    "  - `non functional` - not operational\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
